# React Gallery

## Description

Duration: 1 Week Sprint

For this project I created a gallery page to share pictures of things that are important to me. Visitors can click on an image to see a description and use a button to "like" an image. 

One problem I resolved was making the toggle feature work on click of the image/description.  

Server side code to retrieve data (`GET`) and like a photo (`PUT`) are used.

### Installation

Running the server code requires `nodemon`. If you don't already have `nodemon`, install it globally with `npm install nodemon --global`.

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

```
npm run client
```
Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs! Because we're using `nodemon`, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!

### Other Dependencies

axios
```
express
```
react
```
react-dom
```
react-scripts
```
